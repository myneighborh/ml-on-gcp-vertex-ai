# Building and Deploying Machine Learning Solutions with Vertex AI
Completed four end-to-end machine learning projects using Google Cloud Vertex AI:

1. **AutoML Vision**  
   Built and deployed an image classification model for identifying damaged vehicle parts using AutoML Vision.

2. **BigQuery ML with XGBoost**  
   Applied XGBoost to predict customer churn using BigQuery ML, and deployed the trained model to Vertex AI for online inference.

3. **Vertex AI Pipelines**  
   Utilized Vertex AI Pipelines to orchestrate a fully automated ML workflow, enabling reproducible and scalable MLOps.

4. **BERT Sentiment Classification (Challenge Lab)**  
   Fine-tuned and trained a BERT-based sentiment classification model, deployed it to Vertex AI, and served real-time predictions via REST API using Vertex AI Endpoints.
